rem First of all, 'flip' the cube, that is, try to perceive the smaller square as being nearest to you, rather than further away, as the normal rules of perspective would suggest. Rotate the figure very slowly in its flipped state.  You will find this easier initially if you do not let the squares intersect.  Is the figure a cube, and does it remain the same shape as it rotates?  As you become more used to the illusion, gradually increase the angle of rotation, whilst still maintaining the flipped state.  If the cube flips back when you do not mean it to, press CTRL-F to reset the camera and start again. You can read this help again whilst the application is running, by pulling down the Help menu on the Image window, and selecting 'Application comment...'.
